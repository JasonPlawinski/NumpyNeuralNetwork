# Fourier and Edge Loss for GAN-Based Single Image Super Resolution

This repository is part of the work I did during my year at Osaka University
with the exchange program with FrontierLab@OsakaU.

It contains 4 different notebooks that detail, with indepth comments, basic multilayer perceptrons coded only numpy.

### 1D regression and fit, comparing different gradient descent algorithm (SGD, momentum and Adagrad)

### 2D regression of natural dataset with gradient descent with and without momentum

### Classification of MNIST with different regularization methods (L2 regularization and dropout)

### Full implementation of a GAN with fully connected layers and stable loss function
